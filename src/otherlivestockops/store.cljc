(ns otherlivestockops.store
  "Store abstraction for other-livestock facility/holding records. Current
  implementation is an in-memory map; production should migrate to
  Datomic/kotoba-server (the same seam point all cloud-itonami actors
  use). Mirrors `swineops.store` (cloud-itonami-isic-0145) in shape.

  A registered facility is the minimal unit of authority: an other-animal
  holding (apiary/hutch bank/fur-farm enclosure/rearing house) must be
  registered before ANY proposal referencing it can be considered by the
  Governor (see `otherlivestockops.governor`'s `facility-registered`
  invariant). Facility data is opaque to this namespace --
  callers/backends decide what a facility record contains (name,
  husbandry-line, hive/hutch count, etc); this Store only answers \"is
  this facility-id registered, and if so what's on file\".")
