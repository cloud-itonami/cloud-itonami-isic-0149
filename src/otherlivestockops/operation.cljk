  "OperationActor -- one other-livestock farm operation = one supervised
  actor run. The advisor (OtherLivestockOpsAdvisor) is sealed into a
  single node (:advise); its proposal is ALWAYS routed through the
  Other-Livestock Farm Operations Governor (:govern) and the rollout
  phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today; Datomic/kotoba-server is the next
                     seam)
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)

  One run = one other-livestock farm coordination operation (intake ->
  advise -> govern -> decide -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded
  inner loop -- each operation is auditable and checkpointed. A
  facility's operating history is advanced by MANY operations
  (log-husbandry-record / schedule-farm-operation /
  flag-animal-health-concern / order-supplies), each its own independent
  run.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow: an `:escalate` disposition
  hands the decision to a human operator (farm operator / veterinarian).
  The approver resumes the pending request once a decision is made.
  `:flag-animal-health-concern` ALWAYS reaches escalation when the
  Governor is clean -- see `otherlivestockops.governor/always-escalate-ops`.

  NOTE: langgraph-clj StateGraph integration is deferred (mirrors
  `swineops.operation`, cloud-itonami-isic-0145). This stub version
  defines the high-level flow synchronously; production build wires this
  into a langgraph-clj StateGraph with `interrupt-before` for the
  escalation node and checkpoint-based resume."
